List what you like about each site:
I like the setup of Planetary Society. It is very user friendly. Its large-scale site is identical to its mobile site.
The ESA website has ideas for missions themselves, not just trying to name the mission.
Nasa�s site for future missions is very stripped down and quite simple. I like it for just providing information.

List what you do not like about each site:
Nasa�s site, while simple, is also not very inviting to the user.
The Planetary Society site has everything all laid out, making you scroll through other planets before you get to where you want.
ESA site feels like it can be organized better, like campaigns for planets or have it simplified a little bit.

How my application will be different:
My application will take the positives from other sites, as well as my ideas and gather them in a simple yet user friendly site. Having interactive tiles when you have your mouse over show information, or having an easily accessible site is what I am going to strive for.
